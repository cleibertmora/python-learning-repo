- Control flow structures
- Built-in functions
- Comments
- String formatting
- Indentation
- Ternary operator

Each topic includes code examples to help you better understand the concepts.

## Prerequisites

No prior programming experience is required, but basic math and logic knowledge is recommended.

## How to use this repository

In the folder for this section, you will find code files that you can open in your preferred text editor to examine the code and practice. You can also use these code examples as a starting point for your own programs.

As you learn, you can modify the code examples and experiment with different values to see how it affects the result.

In summary, this section provides you with the basics of Python syntax, which are essential to understanding the language. Good luck in your learning!
